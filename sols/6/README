Project description: Implement python functions. run ./test.py to test all cases

The easiest part of this project: C++ part was pretty easy. grammar was little tricky for me

Problems: 
--> Understanding prewritten grammar was time consuming. It took me alot of time ,tryin to find where I should insert semantic actions. 
--> replicated actions such as == <= >= also were time consuming.  
--> managing statements stack  and scope
