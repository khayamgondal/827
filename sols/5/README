Project due date: Dec 8th, 2017

Project description: Implement python functions. run ./test.py to test all cases

The easiest part of this project: C++ part was pretty easy. grammar is little tricky for me

Problems: I wasn't able to implement 'else' due to limited time. 
 	  There are also some warnings about not used c++ variables
          Alot of grammar conflicts but its working. I believe conflicts are due to as i made changes into prewritten parser. There are always some conflict when you made changes into prewritten code. I worked very hard for this project. pushing back all of my other exams/projects, assignments. There were alot of things which I know that i could have done better but due to all the time limitations, research commitments I wasn't able to do them best.
